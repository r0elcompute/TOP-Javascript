//we use let and const or sometimes var to declare variables

//variables declared with the let keyword can be reassigned!

// var as a keyword for declaring variables is not being used anymore but it is still useful to know it exists
let name = "Rodgers";
let surname = "Mwangi";

console.log(name);
console.log(surname);

//re assign variables
let age = 11;
//concatenatipn - directly adding two or more values to produce one outcome
console.log("my age was " + age + " years old back in 2016");

age = 20;

console.log("I am now " + age + " years old"); //concatenation

//variables declared with the const keyword cannot be re assigned!

const pi = 3.142;
// pi = 20.2;
console.log("The value for mathematical pi is " + pi);
